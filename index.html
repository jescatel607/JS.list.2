        Create a customer input system. <br />
        You can look to using any kind of tools you want an we reccommend
        looking at 3Schools.com for additional information on how to add users
        to the list below.
        <br />
        <br />
        You will notice some in place scaffolding to help get you there in
        creating a product input system. The Javascript file will only reference
        an array, a function, and an object. You must include the array of
        products after adding them inside the console, look inside the js file
        for more details.

        <br />
        Hint: Look for a way to add items to each individual cell of the div
        with the ID of output. Also find a way to prevent users from adding an
        empty name field or customer id.
